# AirportSecurityState

For this project, I used the state pattern to simulate a security system at an airport based on levels of security. The safety of the airport depended on a text file that was parsed to see if there was any potential harm based on various items passengers would carry on them. If a certain number of items were "brought into the airport" the state of security would change fluctuate between low, medium, and high levels of risk. There is more in the README.txt in the folder.
